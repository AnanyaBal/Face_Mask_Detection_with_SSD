# Face_Mask_Detection_with_SSD

This is a Computer Vision project for object detection. I use the tensorflow api for a MobileNet v1-based Single Shot Detector. 

There are three categories of objects:
1. Person not wearing mask (without_mask)
2. Person wearing mask correctly (with_mask)
3. Person wearing mask incorrectly (mask_weared_incorrect)
